# Ripledd UI

Ripledd UI is a set of React components designed for use in Ripledd.v2 projects. It leverages the power of [React](https://react.dev), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) to deliver a seamless and visually appealing user interface.

## Packages Used

- [React](https://react.dev): A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev): A fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports during development.
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com): A simple, modular, and accessible component library that provides building blocks for crafting stunning React applications.

## How to Use

### Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```bash
npm i
```

### Run the Vite Server

Start the development server to preview your components.

```bash
npm run start
```

This will launch a local development server where you can view and interact with your Ripledd UI components in real-time.
